Here are some questions you asked and answers:
— Why we use void?
Answer: In Java, void keyword is used with the method declaration to specify that
 this particular method is not going to return any value after completing its execution.
 We cant assign the return type of a void method to any variable because void is not a data type.
— What is the purpose of static methods?
Answer: A static method manipulates the static variables in a class.
It belongs to the class instead of the class objects and can be invoked without using a class object.
— Can we call static methods from another class?
Answer: Yes. We don’t need to create an object to call a static method since it is belong to class.
If we want to call a static method from another class/package we can basically write the className and .staticmethod().
Ex:  className.staticMethod();
In one class, You can put the class name which you want to call a method from there,
then you put the method name. This will call any static method from any class.
— What is the purpose of return?
Answer: A return statement is used to exit from a method, with or without a value.
 For methods that define a return type, the return statement must be immediately followed by a return value.
